# Movie_Recommendation_System_Sentiment_analysis
### Building And Deploying a Movie Recommender System
1. This website provides the title of the movie, cast-crew details, duration of the film, ratings, release date and recommendation movies.
2. All the details of movies are fetched using API by TMBd and IMBD id of the film.
3. By utilizing Beautifulsoup4, I performed web scraping on IMDb to retrieve user reviews, which were later subjected to sentiment analysis.
